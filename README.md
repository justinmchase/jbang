# Uffda ðŸ¦•

Uffda is a parser generator for domain specific languages.

It is different from many parser generators in that the syntax is expressive
enough to support parsing strings as well as objects, arrays or any other value
type. The result of this capability is that the entire compiler pipeline can be
expressed in pattern matching operations.

## Development

This is a deno library.

#### test

```sh
deno test --watch --parallel
```

#### cli

```sh
deno run --allow-env --allow-read --allow-write \
  main.ts compile \
  --src src \
  --dst dst
```
